# Correlation-HeatMap
This project is a beautifully styled, interactive heatmap built with D3.js to visualize correlation between multiple variables across different domains . The heatmap uses color gradients to represent strength and direction of correlation, and includes tooltips, legends,  cards to highlight key relationships.
